# Bird Classification with AI/ML Project

Welcome to the Bird Classification with AI/ML Project! This project focuses on classifying images of birds from two different datasets: "100 Bird Species" and "200 Bird Species with 11,788 Images." Additionally, we will build a web application to showcase our findings and demonstrate the classification results.

## Project Overview

Bird classification is a fascinating application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It involves training a model to recognize and classify various bird species based on their images. This project leverages two extensive datasets to create a robust bird classification system.

## Datasets

1. [100 Bird Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species): This dataset contains images of 100 different bird species. It provides a diverse range of bird images for training and evaluation.
2. [200 Bird Species with 11,788 Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/200-bird-species-with-11788-images): This dataset is even more extensive, with images of 200 bird species and a larger number of images. It adds further complexity to the classification task.

## Project Goals

1. Data Preprocessing: We will perform data preprocessing, including image resizing, augmentation, and labeling, to prepare the datasets for training.
2. Model Development: We will train deep learning models, to classify bird species based on the images from the datasets. We may explore transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models.
3. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate each models' performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess their classification accuracy. We will also take a look at the training and classification time. The models we will evaluate are:
   1. [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/https:/)
   2. [Yolo](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/yolo-object-detectionhttps:/)
   3. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/https:/)
4. Web Application: To showcase our findings and allow users to interact with our model, we will build a web application. This application will accept user-uploaded bird images and provide predictions regarding the bird species in the image.

## Web Application

The web application will allow users to:

* Upload an image
* Get classification results for the models that we are testing

Happy bird classification! üê¶üîçü§ñ
