## Project Overview

Bird classification is a fascinating application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It involves training a model to recognize and classify various bird species based on their images. This project leverages two extensive datasets to create a robust bird classification system. We will evaluate the performance of various models and build a web application to showcase our findings.

## Datasets

1. [100 Bird Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species): 525 species, 89,885 total images.
2. [200 Bird Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/200-bird-species-with-11788-images): 200 species, 11,788 total images (segmented)

## Project Goals

1. Data Preprocessing: We will perform data preprocessing, including image resizing, augmentation, and labeling, to prepare the datasets for training.
2. Model Development: We will train deep learning models, to classify bird species based on the images from the datasets.
3. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate each models' performance using various metrics, including
   1. accuracy
   2. precision
   3. recall
   4. Training Time
   5. Classification Time

    The models we will evaluate are:
    * [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/https:/)
    * [Yolo](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/yolo-object-detectionhttps:/)
    * [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/https:/)
4. Web Application: To showcase our findings and allow users to interact with our models, we will build a web application. This application will accept user-uploaded bird images and provide predictions regarding the bird species in the image.

## Web Application

The web application will allow users to:
* Upload an image
* Get classification results for the models that we are testing
* Bonus: Enable video classifications (if we have time)

Happy bird classification! üê¶üîçü§ñ
