The "Bird Classification with AI/ML Project" led by Joseph Waldron, Gabriel Serrano, and Hashir Mohyuddin aims to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for the challenging yet intriguing task of bird species classification. Utilizing two comprehensive datasets - the '100 Bird Species Dataset' with 525 species and 89,885 images, and the '200 Bird Species' set with 200 species and 11,788 segmented images - the team plans to develop a sophisticated system capable of accurately identifying various bird species from images.

Key aspects of the project include meticulous data preprocessing, where images will be set up for optimal model training. The team will explore and train advanced deep learning models, focusing on TensorFlow, YOLO, and PyTorch, to efficiently classify bird species. A critical phase of the project involves a thorough evaluation of each model's performance, assessing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, training time, and classification time.

A pivotal component of the project is the development of a user-friendly web application. This platform will not only showcase the team's findings but also offer interactive features for the public. Users will have the ability to upload bird images and receive real-time classification results from the tested models. The team also aspires to include video classification capabilities, time permitting.

This project stands as a testament to the innovative application of AI and ML in biodiversity and species recognition, aiming to contribute significantly to the field of ornithology and technology.
