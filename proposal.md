The "Bird Classification with AI/ML Project," led by Joseph Waldron, Gabriel Serrano, and Hashir Mohyuddin, aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for the challenging yet intriguing task of bird species classification. It utilizes two extensive datasets: the '100 Bird Species' (100-BS) comprising 525 species and 89,885 images, and the '200 Bird Species' (200-BS) set, featuring 200 species and 11,788 segmented images. This project aims to develop a robust ML tool useful in real-world scenarios, such as aiding amateur bird spotters and those searching for rare species.

Both datasets come preprocessed, and divided into training and testing subsets by species. Our focus is on training the models and evaluating various performance metrics. We plan to use PyTorch, TensorFlow, and YOLO libraries for training our datasets. The 200-BS, with its segmented masks, provides a unique opportunity to train models with and without these masks to determine if segmented data yields a statistically significant difference. The performance metrics under consideration include accuracy, precision, recall, training time, and classification time.

An important aspect of this project is the development of a user-friendly web application for public use. This platform will enable users to upload images and obtain real-time species classification results from all models, along with a simplified average result. If time permits, we also plan to include classification capabilities from videos.

This project exemplifies the innovative use of AI and ML in the realms of biodiversity and species identification, seeking to make a substantial contribution to both ornithology and technological fields.
